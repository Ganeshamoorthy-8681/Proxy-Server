# Proxy Server Setup Documentation

## Overview
A proxy server can be used to forward requests from one domain to another, which is particularly useful for avoiding CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. By acting as an intermediary, the proxy server can handle CORS headers and allow cross-origin requests between different domains.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your server.
- **Express.js**: You will need the Express.js framework to set up the proxy server.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager should be available to install required dependencies.

## Steps to Set Up a Proxy Server

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started with the proxy server setup, clone the repository:

#### 2. Run the server 
 - This will run the app using node -  **npm run start**
 - This will run the app using nodemon(development only) -  **npm run dev**
